## About Me

I really like to develop myself, try something new. For several years I had a great desire to develop in the IT field. Of all the areas, Front End was the closest, due to the ability to work with the user interface. To develop in this area, I watch specialized YouTube channels, read technical literature, specialized TG channels, analyze and study examples of other people's code. In my free time, I play sports (basketball), read books, try new activities
